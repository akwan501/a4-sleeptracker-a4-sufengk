4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
N/A

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
when you run ionic serve, it'll automatically take you to localhost:8100. however, my homepage is at localhost:8100/home. please start navigating from there
Also, bug I'm aware of:

    - On the daily sleepiness logging page, the radio buttons sometime malfunction and return unusuable format, resulting in caffeine intake being navigating
        ==> This bug has occurred exactly 3 times in the week or so I've been working on it. I literally cannot predict when it shows up 

You guys should check out the last link on homepage :3

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
Young people who are attempting to build healthy sleep schedules


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
iOS


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
Log overnight sleep by scrolling on two wheels
Easy to see the difference and it's a convenient way to pick time
Additionally, allows me to set minimum range and implement very basic error checking by ensuring that 


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
Offers 3 inputs: sleepiness, whether or not + what kind of caffeine intake there was during the day + stress factors
Chose to add these 2 other inputs in addition to the required sleepiness scale just because those are the main two factors that affect
my sleep the largest + were mentioned in the paper that I referred to for the stress factors

Sleepiness and stress are on a range from 1-7. I used the range so that the user had more interactivity and could visually
see the difference between a 1-7; stress utilizes the same scale to decrease cluttering; radio buttons for caffeine intake to encourage
users not to consume more than one kind together


10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
On a new page, app will generate all the sleepiness + overnight data after clicking a button to load all data
Sleepiness and overnight data also have their own tables but inputs will disappear after page refresh; I wanted to keep a disappearing log
on the page so that the users could SEE their data being logged but not be overwhelmed with data each time they're logging their sleepiness/overnight sleep
and still offer a place to see ALL the data


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
Backing up logged data

12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?



13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
Ionic Storage 



14. How does your app implement or follow principles of good mobile design?
    - Clean UI: no busy colors, simple typography, keeps to iOS experience; simple/single colors, borderless widgets
    - Pages offer clear options for what users should do next; intial page offers viewers clear calls to action
    - Error prevention -- takes values one by one and checks that the second value for overnight sleep (aka when you wake up) is not before you go to sleep, etc.
    - Interactivity -- using colors to indicate Interactivity
